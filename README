## JSON exercise

Using data in file 'data/world_bank_projects.json' and the techniques demonstrated above,
1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.


The final assignment is located in the JSON_Assignment_Final notebook. This contains the answers to the three questions from the assignment above.

Also included in this repo is the JSON_Assignment notebook. This code is the file I used to work with the data and make sure what I was doing was correct.
It is not the final version of the assignment.

The sliderule_dsi_json_exercise.ipynb notebook contains the assignment and relevant functions and methods for JSON files.

The Replace Values notebook is the notebook I used to test out different things to replace missing values. It is not the final version. I did the apply() method
as well as the sort and backfill method in this file.
